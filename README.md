# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my repository! I'm an Android Developer with a deep passion for both creating and learning. As someone who's always exploring the latest trends in technology, I've developed a particular expertise in the Android ecosystem. 

You can ask me anything about Android, Kotlin and Modern Android Development, including Jetpack Compose, Coroutines & Flow, Hilt, MVVM and more. 

I'm trying to master Gradle and CI/CD tools to make my development process more efficient. I'm also interested in backend development; I'm learning Ktor, GraphQL and Postgres for this.

I'm building an open-source project called [Gptmap](https://github.com/f-arslan/GptMap) to showcase modern Android development. Contributions and feedback are always welcome. And you can help me make it better!

I'm always open to new collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch with me!
